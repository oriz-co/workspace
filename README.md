# oriz

> A self-built family of free tools, content, and books — 27 web apps, 15 public JSON APIs, 23 npm packages, 5 books. One person. Free forever for users. Hosted on Cloudflare Pages + GitHub Pages + Firebase Spark.

[![hosted on Cloudflare](https://img.shields.io/badge/hosted-Cloudflare%20Pages-orange)](https://pages.cloudflare.com/)
[![auth Firebase](https://img.shields.io/badge/auth-Firebase-yellow)](https://firebase.google.com/)
[![billing Razorpay](https://img.shields.io/badge/billing-Razorpay%20INR-blue)](https://razorpay.com/)
[![license MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green)](./LICENSE)

This is the **master umbrella repo** (`oriz-org/workspace`). It is a meta-repo whose `repos/` tree submodules every app, API, package, book, extension, and skill in the family. The user always works from here (`c:/D/oriz/`); per-submodule `pnpm install` is wrong — always `pnpm install -r` from the workspace root.

## The 60-second tour

```
oriz.in                  →  this repo's home-app (Astro static + Razorpay checkout)
account.oriz.in          →  oriz-auth-app   (sign-in surface, .oriz.in cookie session)
status.oriz.in           →  oriz-status-app (CF Worker cron + KV-cached uptime)
journal.oriz.in          →  oriz-roam-journal-app (flagship Pro/Max app)
*.api.oriz.in            →  15 JSON APIs (currency-rates, weather-forecast, …)
<slug>.oriz.in           →  25 apps total, each its own CF Pages project
```

| Layer | Count | Lives at |
|---|---|---|
| **Apps** (CF Pages) | 27 | `repos/oriz/own/prod/apps/{hub,content,personal,tools}/` |
| **APIs** (GH Pages JSON + Path D Astro page) | 15 | `repos/oriz/own/svc/api/` |
| **npm packages** | 23 | `repos/oriz/own/lib/npm/` (published as `@chirag127/*`) |
| **Books** | 5 | `repos/oriz/own/content/books/` |
| **Forks** (upstreams we patched) | 2 | `repos/oriz/frk/` |
| **Knowledge** | 58 rules + 181 decisions + 43 runbooks | `knowledge/` |

## Quick start

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/oriz-org/workspace c:/D/oriz
cd c:/D/oriz
pnpm install -r                 # installs every submodule's deps via workspaces
pnpm run env:decrypt            # decrypts .env.enc → .env (needs .sops-age-key.txt)
```

Run any app or package:

```bash
pnpm -F <package.json#name> dev
pnpm -F <package.json#name> build
pnpm -F <package.json#name> test
```

Run everything in parallel:

```bash
pnpm -r --parallel <script>
```

## The hard rules (60 active)

The rules in `knowledge/rules/` are not advisory — they are constraints on every decision and code change in the repo. The most load-bearing ones, in roughly the order they bite:

1. **never-hit-quotas** — every quota gets ≥10× headroom; alert at 60% of free tier
2. **free-tier-with-cost-controls** — cards allowed only if perpetual free tier + hard cap + no silent overage *(replaced the old no-card rule on 2026-06-23)*
3. **community-packages-first** — reach for a maintained community dep before hand-rolling
4. **self-update-on-every-decision** — locked decisions land in `knowledge/` in the same conversation
5. **future-overrides-past** — chat decisions override knowledge; update knowledge immediately
6. **parallel-by-default** — fan out subagents for any parallelisable work
7. **grill-to-knowledge** — every locked answer from a grill-me session lands in `knowledge/`
8. **knowledge-first + no README↔knowledge duplication** — durable info lives in `knowledge/`, never both places
9. **tests-parallel-and-master-install** — Vitest + Playwright + Storybook per app; always work from workspace root
10. **linux-ci-only** — `runs-on: ubuntu-latest` on every workflow
11. **MIT license on every repo** — locked 2026-06-21
12. **mirror-everything-weekly** — Friday 03:30 IST cron pushes to GitLab + Codeberg + Bitbucket + GitFlic
13. **grill-on-LOC-removal ≥ 50 lines** — surface as delta + MCQ before deleting
14. **frontend-design skill baked-in** — every UI task approached as design lead at a small studio
15. **org-level-secrets-only** — push to oriz-org with `--visibility all`; never per-repo
16. **shared-tenant-by-default** — ONE Sentry + ONE GA4 + ONE Clarity + ONE Razorpay merchant family-wide
17. **one-level-subdomain-only on `*.oriz.in`** — free CF SSL only covers one level deep
18. **cloudflare-pages-apps-only** — CF Pages for 27 apps; everything else on GitHub Pages
19. **monetization-centralized-on-oriz.in** — Razorpay checkout exists only at `oriz.in/pricing`; apps redirect with `?app=<slug>&return=<url>`
20. **no-separate-dev-prod-projects** — single Firebase project + emulator for dev; flip when first paying user appears

The complete authoritative list with full text is at [`knowledge/rules/`](./knowledge/rules/). The shortlist above is for orientation — when a rule and this README disagree, the file in `knowledge/rules/` wins.

---

## Env vars

`.env` is the **single source of truth**. There is no `.env.example`. The shape of `.env` is documented in [`knowledge/runbooks/env-management.md`](./knowledge/runbooks/operations/env-management.md). It is encrypted to `.env.enc` via sops+age and that file is committed. Local dev decrypts with `pnpm run env:decrypt`; CI receives the age key as `SOPS_AGE_KEY` secret on `oriz-org/workspace`.

The daily sync workflow (`.github/workflows/sync-env-to-org-secrets.yml`) decrypts `.env.enc` and pushes every non-empty value to GitHub Org secrets at `oriz-org` with `visibility: all`. Every app's CI inherits.

Cards on file (post-2026-06-23 cost-controls rule):

- Razorpay (TEST mode active; LIVE keys pending Razorpay approval of the live site)
- AWS Lambda (4th-rail fallback; budget cap at $1/mo, reserved concurrency 10)
- Modal Labs (Workspace budget set to $0; stays inside $30/mo free credits)

## Domain map

The full subdomain inventory + DNS state lives in [`knowledge/decisions/infrastructure/flat-subdomain-pattern.md`](./knowledge/decisions/infrastructure/flat-subdomain-pattern.md). Quick reference:

| Surface | Hosting | Owns |
|---|---|---|
| `oriz.in`, `www.oriz.in` | CF Pages `oriz-app` | home-app — landing + pricing + checkout + webhook |
| `account.oriz.in` | CF Pages `oriz-auth-app` | centralized sign-in (4 providers) + cookie at `.oriz.in` |
| `status.oriz.in` + `status-api.oriz.in` | CF Pages + Worker | uptime dashboard, 5-min cron, KV-cached |
| `<slug>.oriz.in` (25 more) | CF Pages, one per app | each app's own surface |
| `<slug>.api.oriz.in` (15) | GitHub Pages | JSON snapshots + Path D Astro docs page |

## The directory of agents

This repo is heavily AI-developed. The agent ecosystem:

- **[AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md)** — generic agent entry point (Cursor, Cline, Aider, etc.); just points here
- **[CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md)** — Claude Code entry point; points to AGENTS.md
- `.claude/skills/` (user-global) — 36+ skills available across the family
- `knowledge/rules/self-update-rule.md` — how agents write decisions back to `knowledge/` automatically

When you (or an agent) lock a decision in chat, the **next message** must add a file in `knowledge/decisions/<area>/<slug>.md`, append a one-line entry to `knowledge/log.md`, commit with `docs(knowledge): <summary>`, and push. This is the `self-update` contract.

---

## Standing authorization

Agents may commit + push to `main` on `oriz-org/workspace` and any submodule **without further prompting**, **except** for:

- Paid API calls
- Repository deletions or transfers
- Domain transfers
- Mass deletions ≥50 LOC (rule 13 triggers a grill-me MCQ first)

For anything in that exception list, the agent stops and asks via `AskUserQuestion` MCQ.

---

## License

[MIT](./LICENSE). The source-available-but-all-rights-reserved framing in earlier versions of this README is **superseded** — every repo in the oriz-org org ships under MIT (locked decision: [`knowledge/decisions/architecture/mit-license-all-repos.md`](./knowledge/decisions/architecture/general/mit-license-all-repos.md)).

---

## Open source / commercial separation

- Source: MIT, anyone can read/fork/run
- The hosted service at `oriz.in` (with Pro and Max subscriptions) is operated by Chirag Singhal as a one-person company
- Pro/Max tiers fund maintenance; Free tier is the long-term commitment
